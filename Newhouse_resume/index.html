                <div class="col-md-10 intro"><p>I am passionate about telling true stories to inspire change. After earning a bachelor’s degree in anthropology, I spent two years in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, where I reported on civil resistance movements and taught digital storytelling. During that time, I fled tear gas, interviewed victims of torture and helped teenagers use cameras for the first time. Those experiences instilled me with a commitment to telling stories that matter. When I returned home to Pennsylvania, I brought that commitment to local newspapers, where I experienced how watchdog reporting can drive real change. I am now pursuing a master's degree with a focus on data-driven investigative reporting at the <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/">Philip Merrill College of Journalism</a> so that I can do journalism that matters for the rest of my career.</p>
                <p>When I'm not pursuing stories as a reporter, I research and write children's books about trailblazing women in history. I am represented by agent Jordan Hamessley of <a href="http://www.newleafliterary.com/">New Leaf Literary</a>.</p>

                  <p>I am currently a fellow at the <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/about-merrill/signature-programs/the-howard-center-for-investigative-journalism/" target="_blank">Howard Center for Investigative Journalism</a>, where I am co-leading a team of data reporters examining worker safety during the coronavirus pandemic. In the fall of 2020, I served as a lead writer on <a href="https://homeless.cnsmaryland.org/2020/12/15/public-housing-evictions/" target="_blank">a project</a> that analyzed four years of eviction data to find out why some public-housing authorities are among the most active eviction filers in their areas.</p>
                  <p>As an education reporter at LNP Media Group, I collaborated with another reporter on a <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/leaked-audio-manheim-township-school-board-conspired-to-deliberate-privately-on-superintendent-search/article_ddef2994-cb44-11e5-9464-374c3bc1dc7d.html" target="_blank">year-long investigation</a> of financial mismanagement and persistent Sunshine Act violations in Lancaster County's wealthiest school district. Our reporting prompted hundreds of taxpayers to attend public meetings and demand changes to school district operations, including a more transparent superintendent search and the restoration of elementary art and music classes. The project earned numerous awards, including Pennsylvania’s most prestigious newspaper honor, the G. Richard Dew Award for Journalistic Service.</p>

                  <p>Although women make up about half the workforce in U.S., only about a quarter of science, technology, engineering and math professionals are women. As a reporter for LNP Media Group, I launched and hosted a podcast that spotlighted women in careers such as bridge engineering, forensic accounting and cancer research. Because it tapped into a growing interest in STEM careers and education, the show was the newspaper’s first podcast to land a season-long sponsor.</p>

                  <p>I conceptualized and facilitated two public art projects that highlighted the resilience of people in recovery from mental illness. During the project, I taught participants basic photography skills, and we wheat pasted large-scale black and white posters of their portraits onto wooden panels. The panels were hung outside for a public exhibition. Participants also helped craft the personal narratives that accompanied their photos. Faces of Mental Health Recovery took place in one rural county and one suburban county as part of the “I’m the Evidence” campaign of the Mental Health Association in PA. The project also received support from the Perry County Council of the Arts, Hopeworx Inc., and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.</p>
