                  <p>I am currently a fellow at the <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/about-merrill/signature-programs/the-howard-center-for-investigative-journalism/" target="_blank">Howard Center for Investigative Journalism</a>, where I am part of a team examining public housing evictions across the country.</p>
                  <p>As an education reporter at LNP Media Group, I collaborated with another reporter on a <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/leaked-audio-manheim-township-school-board-conspired-to-deliberate-privately-on-superintendent-search/article_ddef2994-cb44-11e5-9464-374c3bc1dc7d.html" target="_blank">year-long investigation</a> of financial mismanagement and persistent Sunshine Act violations in Lancaster County's wealthiest school district. Our reporting prompted hundreds of taxpayers to attend public meetings and demand changes to school district operations, including a more transparent superintendent search and the restoration of elementary art and music classes. The project earned numerous awards, including Pennsylvania’s most prestigious newspaper honor, the G. Richard Dew Award for Journalistic Service.</p>

                  <p>I cover the national impact of COVID-19 on students and teachers. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak I focused on innovations in math education. I am adept at finding stories and cultivating sources through social media.</p>

                  <p>LNP Media Group</p>
                  <p>2013 - 2017</p>
                  <p>I reported on 17 public school districts for a print and digital newspaper with 75,000+ circulation. I also helped build a stronger team culture by organizing a newsroom Pulitzer Prize reading group and creating a weekly peer-to-peer award called The Awesome Flag.</p>

                  <p>Community College Initiative Program - Digital Stories</p>
                  <p>I led digital storytelling workshops with community college exchange students from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. I planned and taught lessons on topics such as the narrative arc, and I guided students through crafting and revising scripts, selecting images and recording voice-overs.</p>

                  <p>Women in STEM Podcast</p>
                  <p>Although women make up about half the workforce in U.S., only about a quarter of science, technology, engineering and math professionals are women. As a reporter for LNP Media Group, I launched and hosted a podcast that spotlighted women in careers such as bridge engineering, forensic accounting and cancer research. Because it tapped into a growing interest in STEM careers and education, the show was the newspaper’s first podcast to land a season-long sponsor.</p>

                  <p>Faces of Mental Health Recovery - Public Art Project</p>
                  <p>I facilitated two public art projects that celebrated the resilience of people in recovery from mental illness. During the project, I taught participants basic photography skills, which they used to take each other’s portraits. We then wheat pasted large-scale black and white posters of the portraits onto wooden panels, which were hung outside for a public exhibition. Participants also helped craft the personal narratives that accompanied their photos. Faces of Mental Health Recovery took place in one rural county and one suburban county as part of the “I’m the Evidence” campaign of the Mental Health Association in PA. The project also received support from the Perry County Council of the Arts, Hopeworx Inc., and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.</p>

                  <p>As a 2010-11 TMS Fellow I developed and taught digital storytelling courses to 60 students at low-income schools in Hyderabad, India. I also initiated technology integration workshops with teachers at a rural after-school program for Dalit (“untouchable”) children, which led to a partnership between my organization and another nonprofit.</p>
