    <div class="organization">KQED MindShift</<div class="organization">
    <div class="date">2018 - present</div>
    <div class="description">I cover the national impact of COVID-19 on students and teachers. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak I focused on innovations in math education. I am adept at finding stories and cultivating sources through educator spaces on social media.</div>

    <div class="description">I reported on 17 public school districts for a print and digital newspaper with 75,000+ circulation. My year-long investigation of financial mismanagement and persistent Sunshine Act violations in Lancaster County's wealthiest school district prompted hundreds of taxpayers to attend public meetings and demand changes to school district operations, including a more transparent superintendent search and the restoration of elementary art and music classes. The project earned numerous awards, including Pennsylvania’s most prestigious newspaper honor, the G. Richard Dew Award for Journalistic Service. I also helped build a stronger team culture by organizing a newsroom Pulitzer Prize reading group and creating a weekly peer-to-peer award called The Awesome Flag.</div>
