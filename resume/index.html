    <p>I am passionate about telling true stories to inspire change. As a reporter I pursue stories that spotlight important social issues and hold governments and corporations accountable. I also frequently teach digital media classes, and I write nonfiction children's books about women in sports.</p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Education Reporter</h3>
    <h4>KQED MindShift</<h4>
    <h5>2018 - present</h5>
    <p>I cover the national impact of COVID-19 on students and teachers. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak I focused on innovations in math education. I am adept at finding stories and cultivating sources through educator spaces on social media.</p>

    <h4>LNP Media Group</h4>
    <h5>2013 - 2017</h5>
    <p>I reported on 17 public school districts for a print and digital newspaper with 75,000+ circulation. My year-long investigation of financial mismanagement and persistent Sunshine Act violations in Lancaster County's wealthiest school district prompted hundreds of taxpayers to attend public meetings and demand changes to school district operations, including a more transparent superintendent search and the restoration of elementary art and music classes. The project earned numerous awards, including Pennsylvania’s most prestigious newspaper honor, the G. Richard Dew Award for Journalistic Service. I also helped build a stronger team culture by organizing a newsroom Pulitzer Prize reading group and creating a weekly peer-to-peer award called The Awesome Flag.</p>


    <h3>Staff Reporter</h3>
    <h4>Perry County Times</h4>
    <h5>2012 - 2013</h5>
    <p>I reported, wrote and photographed news and features for three rural newspapers in Pennsylvania. I also laid out pages in Adobe InDesign, and I launched and managed the organization’s Facebook page.</p>

    <h3>Digital Storytelling Teaching Fellow</h3>
    <h4>The Modern Story</h4>
    <h5>2010 - 2011</h5>
    <p>I developed and taught digital storytelling courses to 60 students at low-income schools in Hyderabad, India. I also initiated technology integration workshops with teachers at a rural after-school program for Dalit (“untouchable”) children, which led to a multi-year partnership between my organization and another education nonprofit.</p>

    <h3>Freelance Journalist</h3>
    <h4>U.S. and Abroad</h4>
    <h5>2009 - Present</h5>
    <p>My stories on topics related to gender, sports, education and STEM have appeared in print and online publications. From 2015-2017 I wrote monthly features on media changemakers for Images & Voices of Hope. I covered local government and schools for daily newspapers in Pennsylvania from 2011-2012. In 2009 and 2010 I reported on civil resistance in Honduras and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, respectively, for online news outlets and blogs.</p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Master’s in Journalism, Multi-platform journalism, University of Maryland, 2022 (expected). Fellow, Howard Center for Investigative Journalism.</li>
    <li>Bachelor of Arts, Anthropology, American University, 2009. Graduated summa cum laude and with university honors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Public records reporting. Extensive experience with using state open records law - from requests through appeals - to hold public officials accountable.</li>
    <li>Multimedia journalism. At LNP Media Group I produced a weekly two-season podcast featuring women in STEM fields. The show generated new advertising revenue for a legacy media company.</li>
    <li>Teaching. Experience spans multiple continents and children through adults. Focus on teaching digital media and storytelling skills to underserved populations, such as adults living with mental illness and international students at community colleges.</li>
  </ul>
