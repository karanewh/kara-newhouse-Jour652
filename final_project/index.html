They described the instructional and emotional challenges that came with emergency distance learning, along with some of the successes. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.</p>

    <div class="row story-text">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>For Coral Zayas, the best parts of distance learning were live lessons and seeing her students interact during the ‘Fun Friday’ game hours she hosted.</p>
        <p>Those experiences came late, though. Many districts, including the one where Zayas teaches, had a delay between closing schools and starting live instruction, as they worked to distribute computers and tablets to students.</p>
        <p>“I would hope that if we're in this situation again or as we prepare for potential other shutdowns or anything else that might occur in the next year, that (district leaders are) a lot more prepared than they were now,” Zayas said. “Because I don't think it's acceptable that we're one week from school (ending) and we still have kids who never received (devices).”</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Seeing the technology gap between her district and neighboring ones took a toll, including many sleepless nights, Zayas said.
        <p>Her educator network helped her get through the semester. When distance learning began, Zayas volunteered to facilitate a Teach Plus support group that met twice weekly to discuss instructional strategies and self-care.</p>
        <p>“That has been crucial for me, because a lot of times I feel that those who are not teachers do not really understand everything that we do on a daily basis. But teachers do,” she said.</p>

        <div class="row story-text">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Teaching in one of the hardest hit areas of the country made the impact of the pandemic all too real for José Vilson. “The whole first two months and change, we were hearing about 10 sirens a day,” he said. “It can really rack on the brain in a way.”</p>
            <p>Vilson lives in Harlem, just a few miles from his students in Washington Heights. He said that makes it easier to understand what they’re experiencing.</p>
            <p>“I have students whose parents have passed away, whose family members have passed away, whose families also many of them are essential workers. And that's a lot. It's a lot of things going on right now. So we're just trying to manage it day to day.”</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Vilson said the way his school administrators checked in on teacher and student mental health and adjusted plans made a big difference.“It's that human touch that really had been missing for me for a really long time. This year I finally was able to get it, and that was important.”</p>
            <p>Although nobody was prepared for emergency distance learning, Vilson said that after two months he’d developed a rhythm and felt comfortable with the sequence of what he was teaching.</p>
            <p>An unresolved issue, however, was what live instruction should look like. Educators, students and parents had different ideas, Vilson said. “So without that conversation, it becomes really hard to navigate what the expectation is for everybody.”</p>

        <div class="row story-text">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The uncertainty of the first few weeks of distance learning created anxiety for students and teachers alike. For Elizabeth Raff, developing a schedule helped. Her school district did not require live instruction, but she posted daily video messages for her students and organized optional weekly Google Hangouts.</p>
            <p>“I do feel like we finally started to get into a routine once we got into the distance learning … So my students expected the same thing each week, and that kind of normalcy was really important.”</p>
            <p>Finding a rhythm was bittersweet, though. Raff said that schools shuttered right at the “sweet spot” of the school year when the classroom community begins to deepen.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>“No matter how many cool tech tools you have and how much you can integrate, thoughtfully, technology into dynamic lessons online, that kind of stuff, there's just nothing like the presence of being in person with a group of kids and that learning that takes place there,” she said.</p>
            <p>If she could do something differently, Raff said she “would have tried to get that groove going a little bit earlier, because we're just trying to hold on to threads right now.”</p>
            <p>She also would have hugged her students before they left. “I won't see them again in the same kind of capacity, especially because they're sixth-graders and moving on to middle school,” she said.</p>

              <p>Colby Sharp is a father of five children, four of whom are school-age. Both he and his wife are teachers. That meant between kids and adults, they were managing between 30 and 40 virtual meetings per week.</p>
              <p>It’s been tricky, Sharp said. “Today during the Zoom with my students, my 3-year-old was sitting at the table and singing the Power Rangers theme song the entire time. The (students) really enjoy that stuff when the kids drop by or the cats drop by.”
              <p>Students also have benefitted from unstructured time to chat at the start and end of classes, Sharp said.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>“I like to have a bit of a soft start to my school day where kids come in and kind of work on whatever it is they want to work on. Some are drawing. Some are writing. Some are chit-chatting. Some are reading magazines. Just that part, letting them hang out, I think has worked pretty well. Just letting them be 10.”</p>
              <p>Sharp also said recording his own video lessons rather than relying on pre-existing materials was important. “Kids come to school for a lot of reasons and a big reason is for the teachers. We can't be content with other people just showing videos or why do kids even need to come back to school? So I'm trying to give them me as much as possible.”</p>

          <div class="row story-text">
            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Juan Gonzalez Jr. did not use technology too much in his classes. Adapting in the midst of a pandemic created a steep learning curve, but he started out optimistic.</p>
            <p>But when his school opted to continue grading despite disparities in home environments and technology, Gonzalez’s emotional state took a dive.</p>
            <p>“For me, it felt like teaching in the classroom but if five of my kids had to listen from the hallway. People would tell me, ‘Well, you know, focus on the kids who are there, who do have access.’ But I couldn't just focus on them and not think about those who weren’t getting the same.”</p>
            <p>That stress extended beyond the bounds of a traditional school day. Gonzalez said if he could go back he would set a better schedule for himself instead of doing lesson plans late at night. He also said that could have given himself more grace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>“There was this enormous amount of guilt that I kept holding on to. And I think if you speak to any teachers, they'll tell you the same. I don't know why we do that to ourselves. Because we want our students, no matter who they are, to be successful. We want to be a part of that. And so it was just so hard to not feel powerless in that sense. I think that guilt also held me back from doing my best with what I had.”</p>
            <p>As summer approached, Gonzalez looked forward to a break from screens. Typically he travels to professional development events during the summer, but those are all canceled.</p>
            <p>Since he’s looping with his current students, he will use the time to design lessons for fourth grade. “I will hopefully not have to be on the Zoom for a while and then just kind of slowly and ease myself back into prepping for the following year,” he said.</p>
